## Title: CVG (CV Generator mobile app)

### Brief Description:

A CV generation mobile app would be designed to assist job seekers in creating professional resumes that can be submitted to potential employers. 

To make the process easier and faster, the app may offer templates and sample text for users to choose from.

The app would likely have a user-friendly interface where users can input their personal information, education history, work experience, and other relevant details, After the user signed up, if there is no account, and logged in.

Review and make any necessary edits or changes to the CV, the app would automatically generate a polished and professional-looking CV that can be saved as a PDF document to your device.

Other potential features of a CV generator is  the ability to share the completed resume (PDF format) directly from the app via email.

For our mobile app, we are going to use dart, flutter, nodejs and local database.

Overall, a CV generation app would aim to simplify and streamline the often tedious process of creating a resume, saving job seekers time and effort while also helping them to present themselves in the best possible light to potential employers.

**Extra information** : If there is enough time to do more, we will try to cover payment service to get new templates. Frankly speaking, we initially thought to do website generator app which is the same to the CVG but the website app needs many features (frontend and backend) to be included, due to the fact that we have changed our idea to do cv generator app.
